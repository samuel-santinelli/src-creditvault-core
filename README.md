# **src-creditvault-core**

The **CreditVault Core** is a backend service developed using **Spring Boot** to manage **credit card data** such as transactions, credit limits, notifications, and user security. This service provides essential features for a secure, scalable, and efficient credit card management system.

## **Project Features**

- **Credit Card Management**: Manage credit card details, transactions, and credit limits.
- **Transaction Processing**: Handle transaction logs, including successful and failed transactions.
- **User Security**: Implement secure authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Email Notifications**: Send email notifications for balance updates, transaction alerts, etc.
- **Persistence Layer**: Integrates with relational databases using Spring Data JPA.
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Provides monitoring and health check endpoints for production environments.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Spring Boot 2.5+**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Spring Security (JWT)**
- **H2 Database** (for local development)
- **Java 17** (or higher)
- **Lombok** (for reduced boilerplate code)
- **JUnit** (for testing)

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
To run this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java 17+**: [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- **Maven**: [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) (or you can use Gradle if preferred)
- **IDE**: Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code)

### **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/src-creditvault-core.git
cd src-creditvault-core
```

### **Build the project**

To build the project and install the required dependencies, run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### **Running the Application Locally**

To run the application locally, execute the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the backend service, and you can access it on the default port `8080` (http://localhost:8080).

### **Configuration**

You can configure the application by modifying the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory.

Example:

```properties
# Database Configuration (H2 for development)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

# Security Configuration (JWT)
security.jwt.secret-key=my-secret-key
security.jwt.expiration-time=86400000 # 1 day in milliseconds
```

### **Running Tests**

To run the unit tests and ensure that everything is working correctly, use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

### **Endpoints**

- **POST /api/login**: Authenticate user and return a JWT token.
- **GET /api/cards**: Get a list of all credit cards (requires authentication).
- **POST /api/cards**: Create a new credit card (requires authentication).
- **GET /api/cards/{id}**: Get the details of a specific credit card by ID (requires authentication).

You can explore more endpoints by navigating to the **Swagger UI** (if you have it integrated) or the documentation provided in the code.

## **Deployment**

To deploy the application to a production environment, follow the steps below:

1. Package the application using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

2. Deploy the `.jar` file found in the `target` directory to your production server.

3. Configure the environment variables or settings (e.g., database connection, JWT secret key, etc.).

4. Start the application using:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/creditvault-core-<version>.jar
   ```
